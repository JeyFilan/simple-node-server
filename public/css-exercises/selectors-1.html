        CSS is a style sheet language developed to control the presentation of markup language documents. HTML is to content while CSS is to design. Using CSS, you can change the style and layout of your page without changing its content, use one or a small number of CSS files to control how your whole website will look like, and define separate styles for different kinds of media without changing the structure of your website.
        A CSS rule set consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. Each declaration includes a property name and a value, separated by a colon. There are various properties that can be used to set the display of HTML elements, and they are easy to remember since property names are self-descriptive.
        <br>External Style Sheet
        An external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file should not contain any html tags, only the CSS rules. The style sheet file must be saved with a .css extension. With an external style sheet, you can design an entire website by changing just one file. To design an entire website using an external style sheet, each web page must include a reference to the external style sheet using the link tag.element. The link tag element goes inside the head section. For example, mystyle.css is the name of the style sheet you want to use in your web page.
        <br>Internal Style Sheet
        Internal styles are defined within the style tag element, inside the head section of an HTML page. With an internal style sheet, you can design a single page.
